				<h1>Activate an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and establish a whole-of-community incident management structure</h1>
				<p>Controlling a pandemic outbreak is a multi-disciplinary and whole-of-society endeavor; it requires engagement and coordination among government leaders, public health officials, civil society and religious leaders, the business community, academia, and others. The official response, and public reaction, is likely to have other community impacts such as supply chain disruption and public safety workforce shortages. Additionally, the EOC must begin to plan for potential attrition of first responders by establishing a continuity of operations plan to replace and supplement critical personnel.</p>
				<p>A best practice from previous novel outbreak responses is to establish an EOC to host a whole-of-community incident management structure, leveraging existing plans and organizations where possible, that brings these domains together to streamline communication, planning, decision-making, and operational coordination. Ensure EOC is effectively communicating and aligned with higher-level EOC processes and decision cycles through liaison exchange whenever possible.</p>
