				<h1>A Frontline Guide for Local Decision-Makers</h1>
				<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant disruptions to cities and local communities globally. We developed this guide to provide a decision framework for local leaders to think through what will need to be done to help reduce the impact of the outbreak, both by reducing spread and decreasing the number of cases, but also in responding and supporting communities effectively. </p>
				<p>This document is informed by existing guidance from U.S. and global authorities, public health research findings, and lessons observed from countries that have been battling COVID-19 since January 2020. <strong> It is intended to complement, but not in any way supplant, advice and guidance from global, federal and local public health and other authorities.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>NOTE: This is an initial version of the guide. Use the button to the right to send feedback to be incorporated as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.</strong></p>

					<div class="navbar-logo" style="margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:-2em;"></div><h2>The COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
					<p>COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can spread explosively if not rapidly addressed. Different cities will face differing risk profiles and require tailored mitigation strategies, depending on how far the outbreak has advanced in any given location. This document is intended to provide leaders and public officials at state, city, or locality level with a decision support tool to assist in informed strategy and decision-making on how to combat the resulting disease, COVID-19, in their jurisdiction. It is NOT a prescriptive set of instructions; rather it provides context and advice on how to tailor principles of outbreak control strategy, disaster management, and evolving knowledge on COVID-19 dynamics to different local conditions.</p>
					<p>Battling a new virus pandemic is a unique public policy challenge: the human and economic costs of daily or weekly inaction grow exponentially. Early in an outbreak, when case counts are low, losing a week of potential action may not dramatically change outcomes. But as an outbreak begins to spread and accelerate, a 1-2-week delay can be the difference between cases in the thousands or cases in the tens of thousands. Research on the 1918-19 influenza pandemic in the United States has found that early, sustained application of measures like social distancing mitigated community-level impact of the outbreak. <span data-tippy-content="Markel H, Lipman HB, Navarro JA, et al. Nonpharmaceutical Interventions Implemented by US Cities During the 1918-1919 Influenza Pandemic. JAMA. 2007;298(6):644–654. doi:10.1001/jama.298.6.644 <a href='#read-more-endnotes'>view endnotes</a>">(1)</span> It is beneficial to apply strong measures early on rather than to wait, even if those measures feel intuitively premature at the time. Lessons from Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan during the current pandemic likewise affirm that early and disciplined action can limit or prevent explosive spread. However, state and local leaders must also weigh the public health benefits of disruptive measures against the second-order impacts that those measures may have on the economy, vulnerable populations, and other local factors.</p>
					<p><strong>Given that this virus currently has no proven vaccines or treatments, the most important factor in limiting mortality is protecting effective functioning of the health system by urgently minimizing strain. It is important to recognize that cases requiring medical intervention are in addition to the existing healthcare demand.  Experience from China and Italy shows that this virus has the potential to rapidly and abruptly overwhelm health systems if swift and comprehensive action is not taken.</strong> While our understanding of COVID-19 remains imperfect, available evidence from China showed that the mortality rate ranged between 7 to 58 times as fatal as seasonal flu, depending on the timing of the response and the burden placed on the hospital system. In the epicenter of Wuhan, where delayed action meant hospitals became overwhelmed, the World Health Organization estimates that average mortality was 5.8%,<span data-tippy-content="Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). <a href='https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf'>https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf</a> <a href='#read-more-endnotes'>view endnotes</a>">(2)</span> while in other areas of China that had more warning and took drastic measures to suppress transmission, mortality was only 0.7% (seasonal flu mortality is roughly 0.1%). Evidence from China and elsewhere also shows that the disease is most dangerous to the elderly and to people with pre-existing medical complications; these high-risk groups died at much higher than average rates.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>All elements of response strategy should connect to the overarching goal of limiting deaths by minimizing strain on the health system. Rapid and aggressive action can create a positive cycle, in which measures to slow spread will reduce the critical case volume, which will in turn limit pressures on intensive care units, delay peak case volume, and keep mortality under control. A slower infection rate means a less stressed health care system. Delayed action, in contrast, will allow the disease to spread widely, generating a sudden surge in critical cases and eroding care quality and worsening mortality rates. The difference between these scenarios may be as little as days or weeks, as shown in Figure 2, below.</p>

					<h2>Strategic Considerations for Managing COVID-19 in Your Community</h2>
					<p>A community’s strategic posture, trade-offs, and priorities will vary and evolve depending on the stage of the outbreak. Strategy and priorities will shift depending on where a city is in the course of the outbreak and number of cases in their community. </p>
					<p>Given the multiple instances of growing community transmission in the United States, all U.S. cities should be ready to activate an aggressive COVID-19 response as soon as they detect cases.</p>
					<p>A community is likely to face several phases as the outbreak progresses, which may occur in quick succession and build on one another.</p>

						<strong>Figure 3.</strong> Description of the progression of the outbreak in local communities, as marked by number of cases and burden on the healthcare system.
					</figcaption>
					<p>Please note that not all communities will experience each of these steps discretely but may experience them in rapid succession or “skip” steps in the process, especially early in the outbreak, or have to return to early steps if a locality experiences multiple waves of disease.</p>
					<p>Different actions and approaches should be triggered as a city moves along these phases of transmission.  Knowing which phase a community is currently experiencing will be challenging during an ongoing outbreak, especially if diagnostic testing is not widely available. Outbreaks develop quickly and information will be imperfect or imperfectly shared. Decision-making will sometimes need to progress on a no-regrets basis before clear evidence of which phase a community is experiencing is available.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="expand-hider" hidden>
				<div class="expand-area">
					<p>Controlling a pandemic outbreak is a multi-disciplinary and whole-of-society endeavor, and the leadership and management structure must reflect that. Activating an Emergency Operations Center, as would occur in a natural disaster or other homeland security crisis, is a best practice used in previous large-scale novel outbreaks. The EOC should host a whole-of-community incident management structure, drawing on existing local emergency response plans and capacities where possible. Using an EOC enables a community to streamline communication, planning, decision-making, and operational coordination across a wide range of community leaders and stakeholders, including communication and alignment with higher-level (state/federal) EOC processes and decision cycles. The EOC should also have liaisons to, or representatives from, other levels of government, public health officials, civil society, religious leaders, the business community, academia, and others.</p>

				<div class="expand-area">
					<p>Public officials have an obligation to accurately and transparently relay risk information, even (or perhaps especially) when it is alarming. Community trust can make or break an outbreak response, because the effectiveness of social distancing and other interventions hinges on community compliance. Risk communication should follow best practices to mobilize informed action rather than inducing panic. A set of Critical Information Requirements (CIRs) for leaders/decision makers should be set by an EOC, updated daily, and help feed a set of Public Information Requirements (PIRs) that should be communicated to affected populations in a way that is easily accessible online.</p>
