				<h1>Flatten the Curve: a Frontline Guide for Local Decision-Makers</h1>
				<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant disruptions to cities and local communities globally. We developed this guide to provide a decision framework for local leaders to think through what will need to be done to help reduce the impact of the outbreak, both by reducing spread and decreasing the number of cases, but also in responding and supporting communities effectively. </p>
				<p>This document is informed by existing guidance from U.S. and global authorities, public health research findings, and lessons observed from countries that have been battling COVID-19 since January 2020. <strong> It is intended to complement, but not in any way supplant, advice and guidance from global, federal and local public health and other authorities.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>**NOTE: This is an initial version of the guide.  We intend for it to be further developed by local experts as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. We are simultaneously launching a web-based platform for sharing best practices at: COVID_Local.org</strong></p>

					<p>COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can spread explosively if not rapidly addressed. Different cities will face differing risk profiles and require tailored mitigation strategies, depending on how far the outbreak has advanced in any given location. This document is intended to provide leaders and public officials at state, city, or locality level with a decision support tool to assist in informed strategy and decision-making on how to combat the resulting disease, COVID-19, in their jurisdiction. It is NOT a prescriptive set of instructions; rather it provides context and advice on how to tailor principles of outbreak control strategy, disaster management, and evolving knowledge on COVID-19 dynamics to different local conditions.</p>
					<p>Battling a new virus pandemic is a unique public policy challenge: the human and economic costs of daily or weekly inaction grow exponentially. Early in an outbreak, when case counts are low, losing a week of potential action may not dramatically change outcomes. But as an outbreak begins to spread and accelerate, a 1-2-week delay can be the difference between cases in the thousands or cases in the tens of thousands. Research on the 1918-19 influenza pandemic in the United States has found that early, sustained application of measures like social distancing mitigated community-level impact of the outbreak. <span data-tippy-content="Markel H, Lipman HB, Navarro JA, et al. Nonpharmaceutical Interventions Implemented by US Cities During the 1918-1919 Influenza Pandemic. JAMA. 2007;298(6):644–654. doi:10.1001/jama.298.6.644 <a href='#src-1'>view endnotes</a>">(1)</span> It is beneficial to apply strong measures early on rather than to wait, even if those measures feel intuitively premature at the time. Lessons from Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan during the current pandemic likewise affirm that early and disciplined action can limit or prevent explosive spread. However, state and local leaders must also weigh the public health benefits of disruptive measures against the second-order impacts that those measures may have on the economy, vulnerable populations, and other local factors.</p>
					<p><strong>Given that this virus currently has no proven vaccines or treatments, the most important factor in limiting mortality is protecting effective functioning of the health system by urgently minimizing strain. It is important to recognize that cases requiring medical intervention are in addition to the existing healthcare demand.  Experience from China and Italy shows that this virus has the potential to rapidly and abruptly overwhelm health systems if swift and comprehensive action is not taken.</strong>While our understanding of COVID-19 remains imperfect, available evidence from China showed that the mortality rate ranged between 7 to 58 times as fatal as seasonal flu, depending on the timing of the response and the burden placed on the hospital system. In the epicenter of Wuhan, where delayed action meant hospitals became overwhelmed, the World Health Organization estimates that average mortality was 5.8%,<span data-tippy-content="Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). <a href='https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf'>https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf</a> <a href='#src-2'>view endnotes</a>">(2)</span> while in other areas of China that had more warning and took drastic measures to suppress transmission, mortality was only 0.7% (seasonal flu mortality is roughly 0.1%). Evidence from China and elsewhere also shows that the disease is most dangerous to the elderly and to people with pre-existing medical complications; these high-risk groups died at much higher than average rates.</p>
					<img src="/assets/images/epi_2-compressed.png" alt="Figure 1 The epidemiologic curve of Covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases, by date of onset of illness, reported in China, as of February 20, 2020.">
					<p>All elements of response strategy should connect to the overarching goal of limiting deaths by minimizing strain on the health system. Rapid and aggressive action can create a positive cycle, in which measures to slow spread will reduce the critical case volume, which will in turn limit pressures on intensive care units, delay peak case volume, and keep mortality under control. A slower infection rate means a less stressed health care system. Delayed action, in contrast, will allow the disease to spread widely, generating a sudden surge in critical cases and eroding care quality and worsening mortality rates. The difference between these scenarios may be as little as days or weeks, as shown in Figure 2, below.</p>

					<h2>Strategic Considerations for Managing COVID-19 in Your Community</h2>
					<p>A community’s strategic posture, trade-offs, and priorities will vary and evolve depending on the stage of the outbreak. Strategy and priorities will shift depending on where a city is in the course of the outbreak and number of cases in their community. </p>
					<p>Given the multiple instances of growing community transmission in the United States, all U.S. cities should be ready to activate an aggressive COVID-19 response as soon as they detect cases.</p>
					<p>A community is likely to face several phases as the outbreak progresses, which may occur in quick succession and build on one another</p>

				<h1>Focus protection on high risk groups and facilities</h1>
				<!-- <p>COVID-19 poses extreme risks to older populations and those with complicating health conditions. Each local context is unique and each local EOC should create a commonly agreed and regularly reassessed list of particularly vulnerable demographics. Particular attention must be paid to the needs of these populations, and the facilities where they may reside or gather. Reducing transmission among these groups through targeted support measures can help protect them while also alleviating pressure on healthcare systems.</p> -->

				<div class="number">5</div>
				<h1>Reinforce and expand health system surge capacity to avoid high mortality</h1>
				<!-- <p>The mortality risk posed by COVID-19 can grow substantially if a health system becomes overwhelmed with critical cases. Urgent action should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission within health settings (nosocomial transmission) and to find creative means of stretching or expanding existing critical care capacity. Telehealth consultations, including the use of telemedicine oversight of critically ill patients in the emergency department and intensive care units, should be considered as an option to triage cases as well as manage patient care, permitting the continued engagement of clinicians who may have been isolated due to infection, but can still provide medical oversight.</p> -->

				<h1>Risk communication and community engagement</h1>
				<!-- <p>Public officials have a solemn obligation to accurately and transparently relay risk information, even (or perhaps especially) when it is alarming. Community trust can make or break an outbreak response, because the effectiveness of social distancing and other interventions hinges on community compliance. Risk communication should follow best practices and to mobilize informed action rather than inducing panic. A set of CIRs (Critical Information Requirements for leaders/decision makers) should be set by EOC, constantly updated daily, and should help feed a set of PIRs (Public Information Requirements that should be communicated to affected populations) that are easily accessible online and constantly updated.</p> -->

				<h2>KEY ACTION #7</h2>
				<div class="number">7</div>
				<h1>Mitigating economic and social consequences</h1>
				<!-- <p>Pandemic outbreaks can cause enormous social and economic disruption. This is damaging in its own right, but can be particularly problematic if it creates economic disincentives to cooperating with social distancing measures. Mitigating these disruptions can help to reduce the human cost of the outbreak, beyond the immediate toll of the disease itself. Leaders should also pay careful attention to the impact that both the outbreak itself, and the measures to control it, may have on vulnerable populations.</p> -->
