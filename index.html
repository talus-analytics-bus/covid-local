				<h1>Flatten the Curve: a Frontline Guide for Local Decision-Makers</h1>
				<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant disruptions to cities and local communities globally. Given these challenges, we have developed this guide to provide a decision framework for local leaders to think through what will need to be done to help reduce the impact of the outbreak, both by reducing spread and decreasing the number of cases, but also in responding and supporting communities effectively. <a href="#">Learn more about the guide</a> </p>

					<p>Controlling a pandemic outbreak is a multi-disciplinary and whole-of-society endeavor; it requires engagement and coordination among government leaders, public health officials, civil society and religious leaders, the business community, academia, and others. The official response, and public reaction, is likely to have other community impacts such as supply chain disruption and public safety workforce shortages.</p>
					<p>Additionally, the EOC must begin to plan for potential attrition of first responders by establishing a continuity of operations plan to replace and supplement critical personnel. A best practice from previous novel outbreak responses is to establish an EOC to host a whole-of-community incident management structure, leveraging existing plans and organizations where possible, that brings these domains together to streamline communication, planning, decision-making, and operational coordination. Ensure EOC iseffectively communicating and aligned with higher-level EOC processes and decision cycles through liaison exchange whenever possible. </p>

This entails amplifying surveillance, diagnostic testing, and reporting systems to ensure that data on outbreak dynamics is available on a real-time basis to inform strategy-setting and daily tactical decision-making.

				<h1>Focus protection on high risk groups and facilities</h1>
				<!-- <p>COVID-19 poses extreme risks to older populations and those with complicating health conditions. Each local context is unique and each local EOC should create a commonly agreed and regularly reassessed list of particularly vulnerable demographics. Particular attention must be paid to the needs of these populations, and the facilities where they may reside or gather. Reducing transmission among these groups through targeted support measures can help protect them while also alleviating pressure on healthcare systems.</p> -->

				<h1>Reinforce and expand health system surge capacity to avoid high mortality</h1>
				<!-- <p>The mortality risk posed by COVID-19 can grow substantially if a health system becomes overwhelmed with critical cases. Urgent action should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission within health settings (nosocomial transmission) and to find creative means of stretching or expanding existing critical care capacity. Telehealth consultations, including the use of telemedicine oversight of critically ill patients in the emergency department and intensive care units, should be considered as an option to triage cases as well as manage patient care, permitting the continued engagement of clinicians who may have been isolated due to infection, but can still provide medical oversight.</p> -->

Community trust can make or break an outbreak response, because the effectiveness of social distancing and other interventions hinges on community compliance. Risk communication should follow best practices and to mobilize informed action rather than inducing panic. A set of CIRs (Critical Information Requirements for leaders/decision makers) should be set by EOC, constantly updated daily, and should help feed a set of PIRs (Public Information Requirements that should be communicated to affected populations) that are easily accessible online and constantly updated.</p> -->

This is damaging in its own right, but can be particularly problematic if it creates economic disincentives to cooperating with social distancing measures. Mitigating these disruptions can help to reduce the human cost of the outbreak, beyond the immediate toll of the disease itself. Leaders should also pay careful attention to the impact that both the outbreak itself, and the measures to control it, may have on vulnerable populations.</p> -->
