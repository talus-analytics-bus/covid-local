Successful response the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States will require urgent and decisive action by state, local, and community leaders across the country.  The, COVID-19 Frontline Guide was developed by top global health security leaders to support effective decision-making for local governments to better  protect their communities.

To help support this response, we have also launched a companion blog featuring two types of posts: 

* “Notes from the Field” contributed by local government officials offering first-hand experience of dealing with the outbreak;
* “Reports from Experts” contributed by public health researchers on the implications of emerging research.

As mentioned above, “Notes from the Field,”  is a place to share information about how other communities have implemented best practices to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and to prepare their communities for the outbreak – and to share your own stories. Please contact us here to submit your contribution! 

These posts from communities involved directly in response efforts will be supplemented by periodic “Reports from Experts,” a review of the latest research, guidance for implementing social distancing, tips on effective risk communication, and other topics of immediate interest to help inform best practices. 

While we understand that every community faces unique challenges, leaders can benefit from knowing what others are doing in these unprecedented times. “Even in prepared cities like Seattle, health systems are struggling to test patients and keep pace with growing caseloads. The specter of rapid community transmission and exponential growth is real and daunting,” said NTI Vice President Dr. Beth Cameron.

Articles will be posted here 2-3 times per week. They will be sourced from mayors and others coordinating and managing other response efforts  – including you! Articles will focus on a variety of subjects:

* Local evidence of success in implementing different methods of social distancing
* Local response and implementation of national guidance 
* Coordinating the ramp up of your healthcare system services
* Working with local businesses and chambers of commerce in coordinating response
* Considerations for critical infrastructure within your community

Please contribute – we want hear your stories! Posts will be curated and approved by a team of experienced experts and former public health officials. If you’re interested in contributing or would like to connect us to someone that could contribute, reach out to us through the contact us page. We’re looking for submissions of ~500 words on the experience of the communities that you work with.
