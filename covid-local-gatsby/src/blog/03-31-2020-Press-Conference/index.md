On Tuesday, March 31, 2020, the Nuclear Threat Initiative hosted a webinar highlighting the launch of the COVID-19 Frontline Guide for Local Decision-Makers, a product of NTI I bio, Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, and the Center for Global Development.
 
NTI’s co-chairs, Senator Sam Nunn and Secretary Ernest Moniz provided remarks, along with Seattle Mayor Jenny A. Durkan. The discussion focused on the role of city authorities, highlighting many of the lessons the City of Seattle has learned in the recent weeks as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in the city. The major lesson given by Mayor Durkan: act early and act quickly.
 
Their remarks were followed by a panel discussion moderated by Dr. Beth Cameron, Vice President for Global Biological Policy and Programs at NTI. She was joined by:

* Ms. Tina Walha, Director for Innovation and Performance, City of Seattle
* Dr. Rebecca Katz, Director, Georgetown University Center for Global Health Science and Security
* Mr. Jeremy Konyndyk, Senior Fellow, Center for Global Development
 
The panel discussed the impact of COVID-19 on state and local communities around the country, as well as some implications for international audiences.

In the coming weeks, experts will continue to refine the COVID Frontline Guide tool. Next steps include:
* Developing a low- and middle-income environment version of the guide, incorporating feedback received thus far from low- and middle-income communities around the world
* Adding PDF translations of the Guide in multiple languages to the website
