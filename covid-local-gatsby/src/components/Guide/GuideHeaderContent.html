        <h1>The International Guide for Local Decision-Makers</h1>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is creating significant disruption to daily life in cities and communities around the world. This guide provides an initial strategic framework for state, city, and local leaders as they begin planning what will need to be done to reduce the impact of the outbreak in the near term. The guide and checklists were developed by <a href="/about/">a team of deeply experienced experts and former public health officials</a>, in consultation with current state and local officials about the key issues they face. Our focus has been on providing information for both slowing and suppressing the spread of the virus, and also on supporting community needs. </p>
        <p>This guide is informed by existing guidance from U.S. and global authorities, public health research findings, and lessons observed from countries that have been battling COVID-19 since January 2020. <strong>It is intended to complement, but not in any way supplant, advice and guidance from global, federal and local public health and other authorities.</strong></p>

          <p>COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can spread explosively if not rapidly addressed. Different cities will face differing risk profiles and require tailored mitigation and control strategies, depending on the trajectory of the outbreak in any given location. This guide is intended to provide leaders and public officials at any state, city, or local level with a support tool to assist in informed strategy and decision-making on how to combat the resulting disease, COVID-19, in their jurisdiction. It is NOT a prescriptive set of instructions; rather it provides context and advice on how to tailor principles of outbreak control strategy, disaster management, and evolving knowledge on COVID-19 dynamics to different local conditions.</p>
          <p>Battling a new virus pandemic is a unique public policy challenge: the human and economic costs of daily or weekly inaction grow exponentially. As an outbreak begins to spread and accelerate, a 1-2-week delay can be the difference between cases in the thousands or cases in the tens of thousands. Research on the 1918-19 influenza pandemic in the United States has found that early, sustained application of measures like social distancing mitigated community-level impact of the outbreak. <span data-tippy-content="Markel H, Lipman HB, Navarro JA, et al. Nonpharmaceutical Interventions Implemented by US Cities During the 1918-1919 Influenza Pandemic. JAMA. 2007;298(6):644–654. doi:10.1001/jama.298.6.644 <a href='#read-more-endnotes'>view endnotes</a>">(1)</span> It is beneficial to apply strong measures early on rather than to wait, even if those measures feel intuitively premature at the time. Lessons from Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan during the current pandemic likewise affirm that early and disciplined action can limit or prevent explosive spread. However, state and local leaders must also weigh the public health benefits of disruptive measures against the second-order impacts that those measures may have on the economy, vulnerable populations, and other local factors.</p>
          <p><strong>Given that this virus currently has no proven vaccines or treatments, the most important way to limit mortality in the near term is to reduce transmission and avoid over-burdening the health system with a high volume of critical COVID-19 cases.</strong> COVID-19 cases requiring medical intervention are in addition to the existing healthcare demand, and experience from New York, China and Italy shows that unchecked spread of the virus has the potential to rapidly and abruptly overwhelm health systems. While the world’s understanding of COVID-19 is  still evolving, it is clear that the disease is many times more dangerous than seasonal flu (which has a fatality rate of approximately 0.1%). Recorded fatality rates in various countries have ranged from more than 10% (Italy, United Kingdom, Spain) to low single digits (China, US, Germany). South Korea, which has the most extensive testing in the world, has recorded a fatality rate of approximately 2%, or 20 times the lethality of seasonal flu.</p>

          <p><strong>During the early phase of a community’s COVID-19 outbreak, all elements of an initial response strategy should connect to the overarching goal of limiting deaths by reducing overall transmission and minimizing strain on the health system.</strong> Rapid and aggressive action can create a positive cycle, in which measures to slow and reduce spread will reduce the critical case volume, which will in turn limit pressures on intensive care units, delay peak case volume, and keep mortality under control. A slower infection rate means a less stressed health care system. Delayed action, in contrast, allows the disease to spread widely, generating a sudden surge in critical cases and eroding care quality and worsening mortality rates. The difference between these scenarios may be as little as days or weeks.</p>
          <p>Once transmission rates have been reduced and the burden on the hospital system has stabilized or declined, it will eventually become possible to consider incrementally relaxing the range of distancing measures put in place to limit transmission. Criteria that should be in place before relaxing social distancing orders within the community are included below along with definitions of progressive phases for re-opening.  More detailed advice and guidance for this subsequent phase of the COVID-19 response will be more fully addressed on the web version of this guide.</p>

          <h2>Strategic Considerations for Managing COVID-19 in the Community</h2>
          <p>A community’s priorities will vary and evolve depending on the stage of the outbreak. Strategy will shift, depending on where a city is in the course of the outbreak and the number of cases in the community. A community is likely to face several stages as the outbreak progresses, which may occur in quick succession and build on one another. Not all communities will experience each of these steps discretely but may experience them in rapid succession or “skip” steps in the process, especially early in the outbreak.</p>
          <p>It is important to understand that declines in transmission are reversible, and a community may experience multiple waves of cases.  An initial plateauing or decline in cases is not sufficient basis for relaxing social distancing and shelter-in-place measures.  Communities that are tracking a decrease in cases may suddenly see an increase in reported cases due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, an increase in testing or a change in reporting requirements, a premature relaxation of control measures, and importation of new cases.</p>
          <p>Different actions and approaches should be triggered as a community moves along these stages of the outbreak.  Knowing which stage a community is currently experiencing will be challenging early in an ongoing outbreak, especially if diagnostic testing is not widely available. Outbreaks develop quickly and information will be imperfect or incomplete. Decision-making may need to progress on a no-regrets basis before having clear evidence of which stage a community is experiencing.</p>
          <p>These stages are specific to this guide and not in reference to the Pandemic Intervals Framework issued by CDC in 2016.<span data-tippy-content="<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/national-strategy/intervals-framework.html'> www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/national-strategy/intervals-framework.html</a> <a href='#read-more-endnotes'>view endnotes</a>">(3)</span></p>
