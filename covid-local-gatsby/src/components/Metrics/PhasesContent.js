        Phase 2
        <br /> Initial re-opening phase

      should focus on safely re-opening a limited number of critically important
      activities that are either low risk, or for which the criticality of the
      activity merits accepting a moderate degree of transmission risk (with
      appropriate mitigation). In general, this phase should continue to
      prohibit gatherings, activities that entail prolonged close contact,
      and/or prolonged presence in enclosed spaces. Outdoor activities are
      potentially feasible with appropriate distancing. Telework should continue
      wherever feasible.

        Phase 3
        <br /> Economic recovery phase

      should focus on widely re-opening economic and social functions once
      ambient transmission has declined and is being effectively suppressed. Low
      levels of community transmission means that functions involving moderate
      gatherings are possible with appropriate mitigation. Large gatherings
      continue to pose an excessive risk. However, activities that entail
      prolonged contact or presence in enclosed spaces are feasible with
      appropriate mitigation. Telework should continue wherever feasible.

      represents the maximal return to normalcy that is viable prior to herd
      immunity via widespread vaccination. Community transmission is well
      monitored and negligible; virus flare-ups are contained rapidly. Most
      high-risk/low criticality functions can resume.
