     needs, risks, and capacities<br>
     <br>
     </span></b><span lang=EN>The costs and benefits of different response
     tactics will vary from country to country. Community response tactics must
     be adapted to the specific risks, vulnerabilities, and capacities that
     exist locally. Tactics suited to a dense urban environment may not apply
     in a rural setting; tactics that work in a wealthy country with a strong social
     welfare system may not work in a developing country with a large informal
     economy. In any setting, the priority is for local leaders to assess their
     existing capacity and develop a local response strategy that adapts the
     measures outlined below – operational coordination, slowing transmission,
     protecting high risk populations, protecting the health system,
     communicating effectively – to their own particular context. Identifying
     the most critical priorities will also help local leaders form the
     partnerships with non-governmental organizations, national leaders, and
     the private sector that are necessary to bolster existing capacities and
     to enable a more robust response.</span></a></li>

     lang=EN><br>
     <br>
     </span></b><span lang=EN>Controlling a pandemic outbreak is a
     multi-disciplinary and whole-of-society endeavor, and the leadership and
     management structure must reflect that. Community leaders should utilize
     an incident management system to provide empowered operational coordination.
     Decision making ability should be as devolved as practicable to allow for
     fast action while balancing reporting and accountability. This is especially
     important for transmission control in contexts where delays in data
     reporting at the national level make responsive top-down guidance
     unfeasible. Activating an Emergency Operations Center as an enabling
     component of an effective incident management system is a best practice
     used in previous large-scale outbreaks like Ebola. The EOC should host an incident
     management structure representative of the community to improve and streamline
     communication, planning, decision-making, and operational coordination
     across a wide range of community leaders and stakeholders, including
     communication and alignment with higher-level (such as the regional or
     national level) EOC processes and decision cycles. The EOC should also
     have liaisons to, or representatives from, other levels of government, humanitarian
     and development partners, public health officials, civil society,
     religious leaders, the business community, academia, and others.  </span></li>

</span></span></b><b><span lang=EN>Expand risk communication and community
engagement<br>
<br>
</span></b><span lang=EN>Risk communications promote the real-time exchange of
information, advice and opinions among relevant experts and communities facing
risks to their health, social, and/or economic well-being. The effectiveness of
a national response to any major public health event depends heavily on the
ability of national and sub-national leaders to communicate with all
stakeholders throughout the cycle of an outbreak. Public officials have an
obligation to accurately and transparently relay risk information, even (or
perhaps especially) when it is alarming. Community trust can make or break an
outbreak response, because the effectiveness of physical distancing and other
interventions hinges on community compliance, and public trust may be
undermined when messages do not align with local practices, capabilities, and
beliefs. Risk communication should follow best practices to mobilize informed
action rather than inducing panic. Identifying and partnering with community
representatives from trusted non-governmental organizations, faith-based groups,
and other informal structures is critical to building and maintaining the trust
of the community; ideally these stakeholders should be represented in EOC
coordination and planning. In rural and other settings where public health
messaging typically relies on in-person outreach by community health workers,
radio and loudspeaker messages might be considered while adhering to physical
distancing. Utilization of existing community health workers from other
programs may be especially helpful in hard-to-reach settings.</span></p>

lang=EN>Understand the real-time spread of COVID-19 in the community<br>
<br>
</span></b><span lang=EN>A pandemic control strategy is grounded in
understanding ongoing transmission risk in the community. This requires continuous
disease surveillance, diagnostic testing, and reporting systems that ensure
up-to-date information on local spread is available to inform strategy-setting
and daily tactical decision-making. While scaling up and sustaining local
access to centralized testing resources is an important strategy when feasible,
this may be difficult where limited access to healthcare, laboratory facilities,
and supplies may prevent widespread testing without targeted capacity building.
To understand transmission in the absence of widespread testing, communities
can establish or enhance syndromic surveillance (for acute respiratory and
influenza-like illness), integrated surveillance systems (by introducing
COVID-19 surveillance into existing programs for polio, tuberculosis, or
malaria), and other dynamic surveillance tools to gauge disease activity within
the community, including community leaders and trusted personnel who can be
trained as contact tracers. In the absence of widespread testing or confirmed
case counts, countries may want to consider other types of data – such as the
percent of tests that return positive for COVID-19, cause-of-death indicators, infections
among healthcare workers, and excess mortality - to inform operational
decisions. In settings where sample transport, internet connectivity, and data
aggregation may impact case reporting, these delays (in addition to the
incubation period) should be accounted for when assessing “real-time”
transmission.</span></p>

lang=EN>Slow and reduce transmission<br>
<br>
</span></b><span lang=EN>Slowing and limiting transmission within a community
is central to reducing the near-term human cost of the outbreak and ensuring
that healthcare facilities will be able to continue to provide lifesaving and
life sustaining care as well as routine medical services. Decisions on measures
to slow and reduce transmission should be developed based on the amount of
protection they provide and the severity of the secondary disruptions they may
impose. Large-scale contact tracing should be a priority in all settings, as identification
and isolation of infected contacts offers the best enduring protection against
spread of the virus. Widespread wearing of non-medical cloth masks in public
settings is likely to reduce transmission from pre-symptomatic individuals as
well as symptomatic individuals who cannot physically distance themselves. Cotton
masks may be an accessible control measure even in very low-resource settings. Highly
disruptive lockdown measures may be merited – for a limited period – if communities
have the capacity to mitigate the accompanying economic disruption and can use
the lockdown to buy time to reinforce preparedness measures. Countries whose
demographics skew younger and which lack the ability to mitigate disruption to
livelihoods and basic public services may be able to limit their reliance on lockdown
tactics.</span></p>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><span lang=EN>Protect vulnerable
     groups <br>
     <br>
     </span></b><span lang=EN>COVID-19 poses extreme risks to older individuals
     and those with complicating health conditions. Vulnerable groups can also include
     people living in high-risk settings such as informal settlements and those
     working in the informal economy without social protections, or those who otherwise
     live or work in close quarters in factories, dormitories, and similar
     settings. Groups experiencing widespread food insecurity, malnutrition,
     and large health burdens from other infectious diseases such as HIV and TB
     may also be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, although this
     requires more study. To reduce risks to these groups, community leaders
     should monitor and engage with specific locations where high-risk
     populations are concentrated; assess hygiene infrastructure, community
     practices and leadership, and communication practices; develop local
     strategies and guidance for group isolation and delivery of health
     services; and extend basic services (e.g. handwashing stations, masks, cash
     transfer/mobile money) where possible. </span></li>

lang=EN>Reinforce and expand health system surge capacity to sustain healthcare
operations and avoid high mortality<br>
<br>
</span></b><span lang=EN>The mortality risk posed by COVID-19 can grow
substantially if a healthcare system becomes overwhelmed and regular services
cannot be provided or are prevented by strict lockdown conditions. Especially
in contexts where transmissible diseases pose a significant health burden, disrupting
non-COVID-19 health services - such as maternal and child health, immunizations,
and management of noncommunicable diseases - could threaten as many lives as
COVID-19 does or more, so urgent action should be taken to minimize disruption to
routine healthcare. Measures to prevent transmission in health facilities –
such as enhanced triage, improved sanitation and infection prevention and
control, and segregation of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 health services – may all
be helpful strategies. Safe and dignified management of the deceased will also
be an important consideration if the virus spreads on a large scale. Healthcare
facilities should also assess current supply availability and project future needs,
forming partnerships with the private sector to strengthen the supply chain.   </span></p>

     economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic</span></b><b><span
     lang=EN><br>
     <br>
     </span></b><span lang=EN>Pandemic outbreaks can cause enormous social and
     economic disruption. These disruptions are damaging in their own right,
     but can be particularly problematic if they create economic disincentives
     to cooperation with physical distancing measures. These disruptions will
     not fall equally across all sectors of society. Analysis of gender
     dynamics, informal economies, and social and political marginalization
     will be critical to ensure that economic mitigation measures, where
     available, are targeted toward those most in need. Mitigating these
     disruptions can help to reduce the human cost of the outbreak, beyond the
     immediate toll of the disease itself. Leaders should also pay careful
     attention to the impact that both the outbreak itself, and the measures to
     control it, may have on vulnerable populations.</span></li>
